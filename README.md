Project Name: Autonomous Railway Inspection Vehicle.

The IoT project built an anutonomous vehicle copncept to inspect railway tracks for defective joints, missign fasteners, cracks, defective rails, and cracked sleepers. The project has three Yolo models to perform visual inspection via a web camera. The cart also uses ultrasonic sensors for track gauge measurement, IMU for track cant measurement, GPS module for defect localization, and rotary encoder. The compinets were controlled by two Arduinos communicating using I2C. The cart also had a gantry arm to fasten any loose boltd on joints. This project is applicable for both night and day inspections.
